# From Chaos to Clarity: Building a Contest Aggregator

How missing one too many coding contests led me to build an automated tracking system that competitive programmers rely on.

---

## The Spark

It started with frustration.

I was deep into competitive programming, grinding LeetCode, CodeChef, and Codeforces. But I kept missing contests. Why? Because checking three different platforms multiple times a day was exhausting. I'd forget to check one, miss a contest I wanted to participate in, and then scramble to find information afterward.

**There had to be a better way.**

I wanted a single dashboard where I could see everything—upcoming contests, past results—all in one place. When I couldn't find a tool that did this well, I decided to build it myself.

---

## The Vision

**One Dashboard. All Contests.**

I wanted to strip away the platform-hopping and build a hub where competitive programmers could:

1. **Track** all upcoming contests across LeetCode, CodeChef, and Codeforces
2. **Filter** by platform or view everything at once
3. **Review** past contests and results
4. **Bookmark** contests to never miss the ones that matter

### The Stack

**React + Vite** • **Express.js** • **MongoDB** • **Node-cron** • **TailwindCSS + ShadCN**

## Engineering Highlights

### 1. The Automation Engine (Cron Jobs)

One of the biggest challenges was keeping data fresh across three different APIs without manual intervention.

**The Solution:**
I built an automated pipeline using **Node-cron**.

- Cron jobs run every couple of hours to fetch contest data from LeetCode, CodeChef, and Codeforces APIs
- The system checks for contests that have recently ended and updates their status
- Handles API rate limits and failures gracefully with retry logic
- _Result:_ Always up-to-date contest information without any manual work

### 2. Client-Side Persistence (LocalStorage Bookmarks)

Users needed to save contests without requiring authentication.

**The Fix:**
I used `localStorage` for a lightweight bookmarking system.

- Users can bookmark any contest with a single click
- Bookmarks persist across sessions without requiring a backend
- Filter and view bookmarked contests separately
- _Result:_ Simple, fast, and zero friction for users

### 3. Smart Filtering System

With hundreds of contests across three platforms, users needed a way to cut through the noise.

**The Approach:**

- Multi-platform filtering—select one, two, or all three platforms simultaneously
- Toggle between upcoming and past contests
- Clean, responsive UI built with TailwindCSS and ShadCN components
- _Result:_ Users can find exactly what they're looking for in seconds

## What I Learned

Building this platform taught me that **automation is everything**.

Early on, I thought about manually updating contests or requiring users to register. I learned that the less friction there is, the more valuable the tool becomes. Automated cron jobs + localStorage bookmarks meant users could just show up and use it—no signup, no hassle.

I also learned that **combining multiple APIs** requires careful error handling and rate limit management. Each platform has quirks, and building a robust scraping/fetching system taught me a lot about resilient backend architecture.

## Current Limitations & Future Optimizations

Although the platform is fully functional, there are optimizations that can improve performance:

**Database-Level Pagination** - Currently, all contests are fetched in a single instance. Implementing limit/skip or cursor-based pagination would improve performance as the dataset grows.

**Client-Side Caching with Zustand/React-Query** - Adding a state management library to cache contest data would reduce unnecessary API calls and improve load times.

## Roadmap

**Email/Calendar Integration** - Allow users to subscribe to contests and receive automated reminders before they start. Integration with Google Calendar or Outlook to sync schedules directly.

**Push Notifications** - Real-time browser notifications for contests starting soon.

**User Analytics Dashboard** - Track participation history, performance trends, and contest streaks.
