## The Concept

Learning a new skill is often overwhelming. You know _what_ you want to learn, but not the _order_ in which to learn it.
**Inagiffy** solves this by generating personalized, interactive roadmaps.

Users simply input a topic (e.g., "Advanced React Patterns"), and the application consults **Gemini APIs** to construct a logical dependency tree, considering the user's prior experience.

## Engineering Deep Dive: The "No-Lib" Layout Engine

The biggest challenge wasn't generating the data—it was visualizing it.  
Standard graph libraries are powerful but heavy. I wanted something lightweight and fully custom.

### The Challenge

LLMs return abstract lists of concepts and relationships. They don't return X/Y coordinates.  
How do you turn a JSON object of "nodes" and "edges" into a beautiful tree without using a heavy force-directed graph library?

### The Solution: Recursive Tree Traversal

I wrote a custom mapping engine (`lib/map-transform.ts`) that treats the data as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

1. **Root Identification:** The algorithm scans for nodes with zero incoming edges to identify the starting concepts.
2. **Recursive Placement:** It traverses the tree depth-first.
3. **Coordinate Calculation:**
   - `Y` (Vertical): Determined by the node's "generation" or depth in the tree.
   - `X` (Horizontal): Calculated dynamically based on siblings to prevent overlap.

**The Result:** A lightweight, deterministic layout system that renders instantly, with zero client-side heavy lifting.

## Why Gemini APIs?

Latency.  
Interactive maps only work when generation feels instant. The API balance between reasoning and speed made this viable in real-time usage.
